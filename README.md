# Flux Study
Now live in beta, as [FluxStudy on Heroku](https://fluxstudy-3cc38d8670a8.herokuapp.com)!
This webapp project is for everyone, including me, who wishes they could do more with their time. I'm developing this website so that I can keep track of my assignments and other to-dos, gain helpful insights into my study habits, and make the most of the time I have.

## Features
This app is in beta testing, and has the following features:
- Tracking for semesters, courses, assignments, and study sessions
- To-do list functionality
- Progressive web app capabilities
- 
## Planned Features
Over the next several months, I plan to develop:
- Statistical analysis of study habits and graphs to illustrate and motivate
- Guided study timers
- UI enhancements, including customizable course and assignment colors and more themes
- Class schedule, possibly including a calendar view
- Possible Social networking features for users in the same classes, at the same universities
- And more, as beta testing shows the need

## Setup
Backend code is written in Python 3, and HTML Jinja2 templates are rendered and filled by the Flask framework. SQLAlchemy is the database software. All requirements are listed and can be pipped to build a full development environment.
