# Study
This webapp project is for everyone, including me, who wishes they could do more with their time. I'm developing this website so that I can keep track of my assignments and other to-dos, gain helpful insights into my study habits, and make the most of the time I have.

## Planned Features
Right now, this website is in its early stages. Over the next several months, I plan to develop:
- Tracking for semesters, courses, assignments, and study sessions
- Class schedule and to-do list functionality, including a calendar view
- Statistical analysis of study habits and helpful tips for improving efficiency
- Social networking features for users in the same classes, at the same universities
- Progressive web app capabilities

## Structure
Backend code is written in Python 3, and HTML Jinja2 templates are rendered and filled by the Flask framework. SQLAlchemy is the database software. All requirements are listed and can be pipped to build a full development environment.
